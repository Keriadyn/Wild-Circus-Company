<p>Anna Derevko<br/>
<br/>
Born in Russia, Anna was known thanks to the trapeze in big swinging. She's a model for the new generations. We had been able to applaud her in 2014.<br/>
Her sequences of movements on the trapeze amazed us. The quality of its work moreover cost her a silver medal from the festival of the Circus of Tomorrow.<br/>
Since then, Anna pursued her artistic evolution with one copy versatility. She managed to combine two disciplines: the trapeze and the antipodisme.<br/>
<br/>
Irina Derevko<br/>
<br/>
She's the twin sister of Anna. She began acrobat at the age of 4 and obtained her first contract in 2014 to Wild Circus, with her sister.<br/>
This very young artist specialized in the work in the air belts. She was only 17 years old when she was Rewarded by a bronze medal to " Young Festival Europ√©en de Wiesbaden ".<br/>
The exercises in belts remain physically testing and never the less the esthetics is present all the time of the number.</p><br/>

<p>Luis Ferrera<br/>
<br/>
He was a member of the troop of trapeze artists " The crazy steering wheels ". Some describe him as " The spider-man ".<br/>
Hero of the airs, he's going to surprise you by his evolutions upside down. The man evolves without any safety, what translates a staunch cold blood. When you will see Luis at the top of the capital, especially do not forget to inhale.<br/>
<br/>
The three Nukimura<br/>
<br/>
Kira, Asran and Flay Nukimura intervene twice in the show.<br/>
<br/>
- The unstable board<br/>
The material(equipment) consists of a cylindrical roller and a board. The preservation of the balance requires legs movements moderate and brief.<br/>
With their make-up and their suits, the Nukimura transports us in Federico Fellini's universe. Their technique is irreproachable. They realize even a column in three on roller. Not amazing that they obtained the bronze medal to the festival of Monte Carlo in 2013.<br/>
<br/>
- The Carried Pole<br/>
The carrier keeps his pole in vertical position. The support of the device can be made on the shoulder, the forehead, the single arm or the support of belt.<br/>
The equipment has to answer two requirements: the lightness and the solidity.<br/>
Nukimura was a part of some troops Japanese little known before joining Wild Circus.</p><br/>
